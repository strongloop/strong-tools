usage: slt-release [-hup] [VERSION]

Options:
  h   print this helpful message
  u   update the origin with a git push
  p   publish the package to npmjs.org

If VERSION is specified it must be a valid SemVer version (`x.y.z`)
or a valid version increment:
  major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor, or prepatch

If VERSION is NOT specified, then the version field in package.json is
used.

What slt-release will do:
 - generate a CHANGES.md file
 - increment package version in package metadata files (when present):
    - package.json, bower.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, package-lock.json
 - commit CHANGES.md, package.json
    - also commit bower.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, package-lock.json
      if present
 - tag commit with an annotated tag
 - merge tag back in to base branch
   - IF npm-shrinkwrap.json was not previously part of that branch then
     it is filtered out of the merge. If you want the shrinkwrap to be
     permanent then it must be commited before running slt-release.

slt-release will abort if:
 - the tag matching the version already exists
 - the version has already been published
 - the version is not a valid SemVer string

Typical usage, if you want to examine the results before updating github
and npmjs.org:

  slt-release 1.2.3

If at this point you want to publish, follow the instructions slt-release
gave in the output, which will be something along the lines of:

  git checkout v1.2.3
  npm publish
  git checkout master
  git push origin master:master v1.2.3:v1.2.3

If you wish to abort or abandon the release, you will need to revert the
changes and delete the tag:

  git checkout master
  git reset --hard origin/master
  git tag -d v1.2.3

If you are comfortable with having slt-release perform the `git push` and
`npm publish` steps for you, you can use the -u and -p flags and slt-release
will do them for you.

  slt-release -up 1.2.3
